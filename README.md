# Hangman Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. The game has two participants. One player thinks of a word, and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters.

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes on the screen, representing each letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the game will write it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the game will draw one element of a hanged man stick figure.

The game is over when:
- The guessing player completes the word, or guesses the correct word
- The hangman drawing is complete, which occurs after a certain number of incorrect guesses.
